⚡️ About me
------
I am a self-taught Frontend and Mobile developer with over 2 years of experience. I have started my journey by building Web apps using React, Redux, NextJS, but few years ago I shifted my focus to Mobile development using React Native. Have a great understanding of backend technologies and implementation of REST APIs in NodeJS with SQL database. I enjoy learning and experimenting with new frameworks and libraries, any opportunity to improve my skills is my highest motivation.
